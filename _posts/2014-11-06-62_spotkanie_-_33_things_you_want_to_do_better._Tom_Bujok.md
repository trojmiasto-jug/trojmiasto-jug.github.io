# 62 spotkanie - 33 things you want to do better. Tom Bujok

<p>Jak na nas; wyjątkowo wcześnie. Ale uwaga, kolejne spotkanie mamy już przygotowane :)</p> <p><br/>Tom o prezentacji: Business project are intensive and tiring. Tight deadlines often make developers produce the infamous "enterprise" code, the quality of which is the least important factor. "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act, but a habit" Aristotle used to say. Deploying our skills, however, is almost mutually exclusive from mastering them… In this session we will cover 33 things you want to do better, quicker and simpler applying the best of Lombok, Guava, LambdaJ, Mockito, Spock, Byteman, Groovy, Gradle, Logback, Shell and others! Using some real-life examples we will have a peek at the code, analyze the flaw and propose a suitable solution. Not only will we learn how to code better, but also how to raise the bar on a daily basis!</p> <p>Tom o sobie (krótko i zwięźle): <i>Tom is a real geek! He is very keen on tutoring, presenting and live coding, especially in a non-fluffy way. </i><i>He is also the founder of the <a href="https://nofluffjobs.com"><a href="https://nofluffjobs.com" class="linkified">https://nofluffjobs.com</a></a> startup. </i></p>
