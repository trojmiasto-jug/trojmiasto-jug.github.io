# 64 spotkanie - Building Reasonable JavaEE 7 Apps on Java8 called "Microservices"

<p>Specjalne spotkanie, ze specjalnym gościem...</p> <p><br/>Title: Building Reasonable Java EE 7 Apps on Java 8 called "Microservices"</p> <p>SOA, MSA, Micro-, Nano-, Pico-, Femto- or Atto-services: you can call your architecture however you want, but at the end simplicity, usability and productivity will win. Server side applications can be built faster, without any technical "noise", than ever before.<br/>Also, any reasonable Java EE architecture is already microservices "compatible".<br/>In this session I will build a small application based on Java 8 and Java EE 7 and demonstrate some approaches of how to further rethink enterprise apps with Java 8 and Java EE 7. Questions are highly recommended and are going not only to be answered, but also rewarded in real time. If you are interested, we could also deploy the app on docker :-).</p> <p>
