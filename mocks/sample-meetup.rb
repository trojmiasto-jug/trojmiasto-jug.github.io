No specific artistic skills or background are required.<br/>We start every class with 1-minute or/and 3-minute quick sketches so that drawers/painters can warm-up their tools. For our 5-hour extensive Saturday session students will draw the models posing nude for our extensive 2 hours poses at the end of the class. Quick poses will aim at the sketching technique while longer poses will intend to principal lines to how develop the study of anatomy and of shades as well as the student’s observation abilities. Each Saturday class will have a total break time of 1-hour &amp; 20 minutes.</p> <p><br/>We do have an extra-large hall space but In order to insure the high quality standards, the number of drawers / painters will not exceed 15 persons per class for the Saturday classes.</p> <p>(Our other regular classes take place weekly on a Wednesday, 7pm – 9:30pm PM).</p> <p>Our Saturday extended class have become more FUN and CREATIVE with CONTEMPORARY DESIGNS of the human form and this is for ALL LEVELS from beginners and professionals! The Saturday classes will be extended this summer to around 6 pm from the usual 1 pm start-time; this to extend the time and space needed to those of you who like the UNCONVENTIONAL LIFE DRAWING in paint, drawing using the FLOOR and life drawing using unconventional materials for 3-D DESIGN for hands-on CREATIVITY!! As you know we have the very large space and broad natural daylight sources with extra-large windows to support these activities; so for this summer our Saturday classes will have the facilities to support ALL and ANY of these activities! Please do bring all of you materials no-matter how bulky and big they are; glitter, chipped wood, copper, large painting materials, extra lighting props and so-on. At the same time we will preserve a space (and drawing tables) for those of you who just want the normal life drawing activity – our hall can accommodate all! We also have the facilities for you to wash your paint brushes and items over and over again.</p> <p>We will also be providing LARGE ROLL DRAWING / SKETCHING PAPER of up to 3 meters per person at a prescribed cost per meter for those of you that wish to purchase a length from us.

Alternatively a large desk will be provided for those of you that prefer this. The normal A1 and A3 sized paper will also be provided for as usual at the normal costs per sheet. As usual the chalk, pencils and the rest are FREE for all to use at any time. As normal our subjects will be 1 -2 nude models male or female but do feel free to draw, paint or design other subjects around you.</p> <p>In any case our hall is large and airy but for those of you who want that extra cool breeze our large windows and fire-escape door can be left open. We also have large electric fans that can be left on subtly. If you want a small heater beside you then please ask – this can be provided for.</p> <p>Of-course contemporary art &amp; Design can also be done by artists during our week-day Wednesday class but artists are restricted by the 2 hour time-limit; unlike our Weekend 5 - 6 hour extended time – its your choice!</p> <p><b>Food and Refrigeration</b></p> <p>You are welcome to bring along pre-packed meals and snacks as we have 3 refrigerators to keep them fresh should you want to.</p> <p><b>Weekend FREE parking!</b></p> <p>Yes, we have FREE parking right in front of the Limehouse Hall every weekend – absolutely FREE!

During the course of his lifetime Niemeyer redefined the interaction between architecture and public space, imbuing the ideas of Bauhaus and Le Corbusier with a radically new perspective. More than once he came up with a way of reimagining both national identity and government, as well as the state as a provider of culture and knowledge. In 1968 the Brazilian was invited by Algeria’s then socialist president to embark on a series of ambitious, politically driven projects that he worked on until 1975. Throughout his longstanding investigation of place the artist Jason Oddy has sought to lay bare the usually imperceptible forces that lie embedded in the built environment. In his series Concrete Spring, he once again treats manmade space as an ideological prism. In so doing this body of work places questions such as those of national awakening, the durability of humanist ideals, the amplification of the democratic agora and the transformative power of architecture centre stage. Author and art critic Ben Lewis will be chairing the panel formed by Olivier Richon (Professor at the Royal College of Art), Owen Hopkins (Architecture Programme Curator at the Royal Academy of Arts), Ricardo de Ostos (NaJa &amp; deOstos Director) and Jason Oddy. Together, they will discuss modernism, Niemeyer, phenomenologically engaged photography and the challenges architecture faces amidst the radically shifting geo-political landscape of our time.</p> <p>Tickets must be booked in advance by sending an email to the following address: [masked].</p>", "event_url" => "http://www.meetup.com/Architecture-Art/events/230543148/", "yes_rsvp_count" => 21, "name" => "Talk at the Embassy of Brazil: Oscar Niemeyer's Algerian decade.", "id" => "230543148", "time" => 1461864600000, "updated" => 1461248185000, "group" => {"join_mode" => "open", "created" => 1413223656000, "name" => "Architecture & Art", "group_lon" => -0.18000000715255737, "id" => 17596122, "urlname" => "Architecture-Art", "group_lat" => 51.5099983215332, "who" => "passioner"}, "status" => "upcoming"}, {"utc_offset" => 3600000, "venue" => {"country" => "gb", "localized_country_name" => "United Kingdom", "city" => "London", "phone" => "07775435688", "address_1" => "16-18 Heneage Street", "address_2" => "Shoreditch", "name" => "The Rag Factory", "lon" => -0.069778, "id" => 19542822, "lat" => 51.519028, "repinned" => false}, "rsvp_limit" => 50, "headcount" => 0, "distance" => 1.3037340641021729, "visibility" => "public", "waitlist_count" => 0, "created" => 1454013851000, "fee" => {"amount" => 35, "accepts" => "paypal", "description" => "per person", "currency" => "GBP", "label" => "Price", "required" => "1"}, "maybe_rsvp_count" => 0, "description" => "<p>The 5 week course will cover the basics to screen acting, but you will learn tricks of the trade about acting in a smaller environment and still trying to give a powerful performance.

Well, not the whole market, mainly for the Italian art of the end of the last century. A shift in government policy encouraged Italian collectors to sell their late-20th century and contemporary works on the international market. While this has meant a boom in the showing and collecting of many of the big names in Italian art, it has also meant that there’s been a bit of Renaissance of contemporary Italian art and artists, and there’s still time for collectors to get onboard this trend. While many of the pieces on the market currently have prices that go into the millions of pounds, there are some amazing contemporary Italian artists based in London whose work is fresh, exciting, and collectable. Roberto Grosso’s solo show is the perfect opportunity to talk about the latest trends of the art market while enjoying some absolutely stunning digital art pieces. Join us!</p> <p><br/>The event is free, but please don't forget to RSVP!</p> <p>Contact email: [masked]</p> <p><br/>About the pop up week: our main event is Roberto Grosso’s solo show, opening on the 28th of April at 6pm. Inspired by music, Roberto uses digital tools to manipulate images and transform the audio world into the visual. On their own they are dynamic, engaging, and vibrant, but adding to their visual appeal is their integration of virtual reality. Using the app Aurasma, you can view the works in a multidimensional way, combining sound and movement, and getting a glimpse into the creative process to make the works truly come alive.</p> <p><br/>Private view: 28th April, 6PM</p> <p>Art Collectors Meet Up: 30th April, 5PM</p> <p>Art Fundraisers Meet Up: 1st May, 2PM</p> <p>Art Bloggers Meet Up: 1st May, 5PM</p> <p><br/>Exhibition opening times: 28th April - 3rd May 2016, 11AM - 7PM every day</p> <p>Location: Space W10 (London, North Kensington)</p> <p>Website: <a href=\"http://www.artsmartcontemporary.com/\"><a href=\"http://www.artsmartcontemporary.com/\" class=\"linkified\">http://www.artsmartcontemporary.com/</a></a></p> <p>Facebook event: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/930889513696468/\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/930889513696468/\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.facebook.com/events/930889513696468/</a></a></p>", "how_to_find_us" => "591-593 Harrow Road (Corner of Ladbroke Grove & Harrow Road) W10 4RA, London", "event_url" => "http://www.meetup.com/London-Young-Art-Collectors-Meetup/events/230379980/", "yes_rsvp_count" => 4, "name" => "Let's talk about the latest trends of the art market!", "id" => "230379980", "time" => 1462032000000, "updated" => 1460665221000, "group" => {"join_mode" => "open", "created" => 1451665814000, "name" => "London Young Art Collectors Meetup", "group_lon" => -0.20999999344348907, "id" => 19257499, "urlname" => "London-Young-Art-Collectors-Meetup", "group_lat" => 51.47999954223633, "who" => "Members"}, "status" => "upcoming"}, {"utc_offset" => 3600000, "venue" => {"country" => "gb", "localized_country_name" => "United Kingdom", "city" => "London SW7 5HL ", "address_1" => "188 Queen's Gate", "name" => "Bulgarian Cultural Institute", "lon" => -0.179438, "id" => 23511933, "lat" => 51.499878, "repinned" => false}, "headcount" => 0, "distance" => 3.6956143379211426, "visibility" => "public", "waitlist_count" => 0, "created" => 1460497500000, "maybe_rsvp_count" => 0, "description" => "<p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/b/e/8/5/600_448848773.jpeg\" /></p> <p>The Bulgarian Cultural Institute London presents an exhibition of paintings, sculpture and works on paper by Rosen Daskalov.</p> <p>RSVP: <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/exhibition-opening-rosen-daskalov-tickets-24517854563\" class=\"linkified\">https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/exhibition-opening-rosen-daskalov-tickets-24517854563</a></p>", "event_url" => "http://www.meetup.com/creativelondon/events/230326889/", "yes_rsvp_count" => 25, "name" => "Exhibition Opening: Rosen Daskalov", "id" => "230326889", "time" => 1462039200000, "updated" => 1460497562000, "group" => {"join_mode" => "open", "created" => 1418138335000, "name" => "London Art | Exhibition Meetup", "group_lon" => -0.14000000059604645, "id" => 18242646, "urlname" => "creativelondon", "group_lat" => 51.5099983215332, "who" => "Art Fans"}, "status" => "upcoming"}, {"utc_offset" => 3600000, "venue" => {"country" => "gb", "localized_country_name" => "United Kingdom", "city" => "London", "address_1" => "Gateforth Street NW8 8EH", "name" => "The Cockpit Theatre", "lon" => -0.169092, "id" => 24272956, "lat" => 51.524441, "repinned" => false}, "headcount" => 0, "distance" => 2.992198944091797, "visibility" => "public", "waitlist_count" => 0, "created" => 1460018575000, "maybe_rsvp_count" => 0, "description" => "<p>This is a rare chance to see the special mysterious version of Hamlet in Central London at The Cockpit Theatre in Marylebone.</p> <p>It’s the Hamlet you may never have heard of: compact, active, and the first version printed in Shakespeare’s name. </p> <p>It vanished for two centuries, until a copy turned up in a broom cupboard, causing a sensation. </p> <p>Is it Shakespeare’s first draft, a pirate forgery, or the play that enthralled audiences four hundred years ago?

With unrivalled, magnificent sights across the English Channel, the White Cliffs of Dover are one the world’s most famous landmarks.</p> <p><br/>The first point of reference on the walk is Deal Castle. built in the 16th century by order of Henry VIII and is one of the finest Tudor artillery castles in England. The last sight before the steep climb on to the White Cliffs is Walmer Castle, also built during the reign of King Henry VIII. Intended as part of a chain of coastal artillery defences.</p> <p>Heading away from the towns, the sight that demands your attention is the cliff rising up high ahead of the flat coastal path. After a short period on road, the climb up the cliff gives a fantastic view looking back to Deal, Ramsgate and Pegwell Bay in the distance. </p> <p>The path heads down quiet roads to St Margaret’s Bay, whose claims to fame are being the first place in the British Isles to get the sunlight each morning and being home to both Ian Fleming, author of the much loved James Bond adventures and English playwright, Noel Coward.</p> <p>On the cliff top the sights of the Port of Dover and Dover Castle comes in view. High on its hilltop, Dover Castle is a strategic hill fort used since the Iron Age. </p> <p><img src=\"http://photos1.meetupstatic.com/photos/event/8/4/5/6/600_448173878.jpeg\" /></p> <p><b>The walk is 10 miles.
